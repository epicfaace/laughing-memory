General Guidelines for the project:

*       Ideas for effective data augmentation: Classical techniques (Augmentor/imageio libraries) + Change contrast of images + use Gaussian random noise + Mix randomly masks to generate (Q:)

FIRST STAGE:

        -1º: Try to overfit one image (With a shallow NN) (Q:How to modify U-Net, FCN-8 or Detectron for each m)
        -2º: Do the same with 10, 100 and 670 images: Reject the models that have a performance that stagnates with size during the process. (Note that Batch Norm will be needed pretty soon!)
        -3º: Once you have chosen the final architectures —> go for hyper parameter tuning.

Other Observations: Always use Keras for fast prototipying —> Tensorflow at the end (Increase performance)

LATER STAGES:

-U-net
-FCN-8
-Detectron https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron
